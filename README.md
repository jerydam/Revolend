Revolend is a next-generation DeFi protocol transforming peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and borrowing through a secure, collateral-backed dApp. Designed to overcome the inefficiencies of traditional finance, Revolend offers users a faster, more transparent, and more accessible lending experience.

Powered by the Swell test network, Revolend brings together robust smart contracts, seamless integrations, and a highly intuitive front-end interface. Users enjoy complete control over their assets and data, secured through wallet or email login — ensuring privacy and security at every step.

With the Revolend dashboard, accessing the platform's full suite of features is effortless. Unlike traditional financial systems that involve lengthy approvals, high fees, and intermediaries, Revolend provides:
* Instant access to lending and borrowing markets without the need for banks or credit checks
* Greater transparency through blockchain technology, ensuring fair and tamper-proof transactions
* Lower fees and better rates thanks to the low gas fees on Swell network and the elimination of middlemen
* 24/7 global accessibility — no waiting for business hours or paperwork
* Enhanced security and user ownership of funds

## Benefits for Lenders on Revolend:

### Attractive Returns:
Lenders earn interest on the funds they lend, based on the agreed loan terms — offering potentially higher yields compared to traditional savings accounts or investments.

### Collateral-Backed Security:
Every loan is backed by collateral. If a borrower fails to repay, the lender can claim the collateral, reducing the risk of loss.

### Decentralized, Trustless Transactions:
Lenders do not need to trust the borrower personally — smart contracts automatically enforce the loan terms and collateral handling.

### Full Control Over Funds:
Lenders choose which loans to fund based on the borrower's terms, amount, interest rate, and duration. They stay fully in control of where and how they allocate their capital.

### Transparency:
All loan details, collateral, and borrower activities are recorded transparently on-chain, giving lenders a clear view before making decisions.

### Private and Secure Communication:
Lenders can communicate directly with borrowers through Revolend’s decentralized chat while maintaining full privacy.

### Participation in a Growing DeFi Ecosystem:
As Revolend grows and adds more supported tokens and features, lenders benefit from a wider range of investment opportunities.

## Benefits for Borrowers on Revolend:

### Access to Flexible Loans:
Borrowers can quickly access loans by providing collateral, without needing to go through lengthy credit checks like traditional banks require.

### Decentralized and Permissionless:
Anyone can borrow without middlemen, paperwork, or restrictions, as long as they meet the collateral requirements.

### Fast Funding:
Borrowers can receive funding almost instantly once a lender accepts their loan request, speeding up financial access.

### Privacy and Security:
Borrowers maintain control over their wallets and assets, with no need to expose personal information.

### Clear, Agreed Terms:
Loan amount, interest rate, duration, and collateral are all transparent and set before the loan starts — no hidden fees or surprises.

### Ownership of Collateral:
If no lender funds the loan before expiry, the borrower can reclaim their collateral easily and without penalties.

### Decentralized Communication:
Borrowers can chat securely and privately with potential lenders to discuss loan terms if needed.

### Opportunity for Building Trust:
Frequent successful repayments can help borrowers build a reputation within the Revolend ecosystem, potentially making it easier to get better loan terms in the future.
Revolend delivers a lending experience that not only matches but exceeds the capabilities of traditional finance, empowering users with true financial freedom.

![File](https://supposed-emerald-snake.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmZPhaWDPWozgjnK9EGMZtoUUSFaDpMJNzor9NVRssJFDy)
Since Revolend is currently deployed on the Swell network's testnet, you will need testnet ETH to cover gas fees during transactions.
You can easily obtain testnet ETH through the [Swell testnet bridge](https://superbridge.swellnetwork.io).

### Web app homepage
The homepage of the Revolend web app is the first page you’ll see when you visit the platform. It serves as the gateway to the Revolend dashboard and features the Connect Wallet button, along with important resources such as platform information and documentation.

 ### The Revolend Dashboard
This is the core functional area of Revolend, bringing together the platform’s most essential features — including user balances, key metrics, the P2P lending and borrowing dApp and Swap.

### User's Balances
![File](https://supposed-emerald-snake.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmdchkDr7Zh7vn2rd2cQEj15RM3LGydq5bu5yBHcgfHPdA)
This section of the dashboard shows all the balances of a user after logging in. It displays the following info for a user: RVL balance, RVL price, ETH balance, number of loans you created, number of loans you funded.

### Metrics
![File](https://supposed-emerald-snake.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmWhNyiFPcLhrng9mXQNQKmoArt7z6WaXZTSto8ia4D4is)
The metrics section shows live updates to Revolend including the following: RVL Total Supply, RVL Price, Protocol Blockchain, Total number of Loans, Max Loan Amount, Min Loan Amount, contract addresses of all contracts used by the protocol and Live ETH market chart.


## P2P Lend/Borrow dApp
Revolend enables users to participate in unique P2P lending and borrowing activities involving supported tokens. To initiate the process, a borrower creates a loan request using the "Approve/Create Loan" buttons in the Borrow section. A lender can then fund the loan by using the "Fund Loan" button in the Lend section.
Each loan on Revolend is defined by a loan amount, an interest rate, an expiry date, and collateral. The borrower's collateral is securely locked by the system until the loan's expiry. If no lender funds the loan before the expiry, the borrower can reclaim their collateral using the "Withdraw Collateral" button in the Lend section. Borrowers who successfully receive funding can withdraw the borrowed tokens using the "Withdraw Loan" button.
If a borrower fails to repay the loan by the expiry date, the lender has the right to claim the posted collateral through the "Claim Collateral" button. Lenders are rewarded generously based on the agreed terms of the loan, with additional security provided by Revolend’s advanced security algorithms.
When borrowing through Revolend, users must present sufficient collateral and repay the borrowed amount with interest using the "Repay Loan" button to fulfill their obligations.
For a better user experience, the dApp integrates features like a "View All Available Loans" section and a "View Your Loans" section, along with search functionality and pagination to easily navigate between loans. A decentralized chat is also available, allowing lenders and borrowers to communicate privately and efficiently.
New supported tokens and collateral options will continue to be added to the platform over time, ensuring Revolend remains dynamic and versatile.

### Borrowing
![File](https://supposed-emerald-snake.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmcERVwsrhnBpy7qfZ1Ep7D2MbCFTRCqVFhnzBtc8TWu8G)
To borrow, follow the steps below (Your wallet will popup to sign the transactions):
* Fill the details above setting the duration, amount of ETH to borrow, collateral, collateral amount, "yes if collateral is ERC20 or no if collateral is ERC721 (an NFT)", and interest rate (which is the amount of interest you will pay to any user that funds your loan).
* Click on the "Approve" button to approve the loan transaction.
* Proceed to create the loan by clicking on the "Create Loan Request" button.
After creating the loan, you will be automatically navigated to the Lending section where you can monitor all your created/funded loans.

### Lending
![File](https://supposed-emerald-snake.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmQ8Pxpy1NtkqS4RrrnHDxCngPVNDUEjPtuLSubAaGT8NF)

![File](https://supposed-emerald-snake.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmTLzrr2T2TZffZxFiU1Akjeb3yBpLhDwySHegh2bWTK9K)
Lending on Revolend is simpler than you might expect. Thanks to a smooth and intuitive user experience, users can easily carry out all lending activities. The platform features dedicated sections like "View All Loans", "Loans You Funded", and "Loans You Created" to help users effortlessly track their loan activities.
Search and pagination functionalities further enhance the usability of this powerful lending dApp.
To start lending, users can easily navigate and interact with the available action buttons provided within the dApp.
* Fund loan: This button is the button a user clicks on to fund a loan created by a borrower. No user can fund his own loan.
* Claim collateral: The claim collateral button is typically available for the lender to use in case a borrower fails to repay a loan during the specified duration in the loan. You can only claim collateral of a loan you funded.
* Withdraw loan: This button can be used by the borrower of a loan to withdraw the loan after it has been funded by a lender.
* Repay loan: This button is available to only the borrower of a loan such that before the end of the loan duration, the borrower uses it to repay the borrowed amount with interest.
* Withdraw collateral: In the event that there is no lender of a loan you created as a borrower, you can use this button to withdraw your collateral back. You can use this button only when your loan has not been funded.

### Revolend Decentralised Chat System
![File](https://supposed-emerald-snake.myfilebase.com/ipfs/Qmc3PiEqJm73qdCaRcbeqZExETSjJZjjPtE3wygG69R6Df)
For effective communication between borrowers and lenders, Revolend provides a built-in decentralized chat system. Only the borrower and lender associated with a specific loan can communicate through this chat.
Please note: do not send funds directly to the lender or borrower. All transactions are securely managed by the dApp itself.

### Revolend Token (RVL)
The Revolend Token (RVL) is the native token of the Revolend platform and is primarily used as collateral for lending activities.
In addition to RVL, users can also use other supported tokens like USDT and DAI as collateral.

## Revolend Swap Feature with Chainlink Oracles
Revolend offers a seamless and secure token swap feature, integrated with Chainlink Oracles to ensure accurate and reliable price feeds. This allows users to efficiently swap a variety of tokens directly within the platform.

Currently, users can swap the following tokens:

* ETH (Ethereum)

* RVL (Revolend Token)

* USDT (Tether)

* DAI (Dai Stablecoin)

With the integration of Chainlink Oracles, the platform ensures that the swap rates reflect the most up-to-date market prices, providing users with fair and transparent exchange rates every time. This integration guarantees accuracy and trustworthiness in token conversions, removing the need for manual price checks or reliance on third-party services.
Whether you're a lender, borrower, or general user on Revolend, this swap feature provides flexibility and convenience, making it easy to exchange tokens directly within the platform. The process is fast, secure, and powered by decentralized oracles, ensuring that you get the best rates available at the time of your transaction.

# Revolend Token Swap Feature with Chainlink Oracles

Revolend's token swap feature enables users to exchange tokens seamlessly within the platform, leveraging Chainlink Oracles for real-time, accurate price feeds. This ensures fair and transparent swap rates for supported tokens: ETH, RVL (Revolend Token), USDT, and DAI. The feature is powered by a Solidity smart contract (`Swapper.sol`) that integrates liquidity pools, Chainlink price feeds, and secure token swapping mechanisms.


## Features
- **Supported Tokens:** Swap between ETH, RVL, USDT, and DAI.
- **Chainlink Oracles:** Real-time price feeds ensure accurate market rates.
- **Liquidity Pools:** Decentralized pools maintain token balances for swaps.
- **Slippage Protection:** A 98% slippage tolerance prevents unfavorable trades.
- **Security:** Reentrancy protection and Ownable access control.
- **Flexibility:** Supports ETH-to-token, token-to-ETH, and token-to-token swaps.
- **Liquidity Management:** Users can add or remove liquidity to/from pools.
- **Extensibility:** Admins can add new tokens with custom price feeds.

## Smart Contract Overview
The `Swapper.sol` contract is built with the following key components:

- **Token Struct:** Stores token metadata (address, decimals, name, Chainlink price feed).
- **LiquidityPool Struct:** Manages balances for token pairs.
- **token Prices:** Fallback prices for tokens (e.g., ETH at $1755, RVL at 0.0003 ETH).

### Swap Functions
- `swapTokensForTokens`: Swap between ERC20 tokens.
- `swapEthForTokens`: Swap ETH for ERC20 tokens.
- `swapTokensForEth`: Swap ERC20 tokens for ETH.

### Liquidity Functions
- `addLiquidity`: Add tokens or ETH to a pool.
- `removeLiquidity`: Withdraw liquidity from a pool.

### Admin Functions
- `addToken`: Add new tokens with price feeds (owner-only).

The contract uses OpenZeppelin's `IERC20`, `Ownable`, and `ReentrancyGuard` for secure token interactions and access control, and Chainlink's `AggregatorV3Interface` for price feeds.

## Code Explanation

Below is a detailed breakdown of the key components and functions in `Swap.sol`.

### 1. Contract Setup and Dependencies
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

import "../lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import "../lib/chainlink-brownie-contracts/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";
import "../lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "../lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract Swapper is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
    // ...
}
```
- **Dependencies:** Uses OpenZeppelin for ERC20 token interactions, ownership, and reentrancy protection; Chainlink for price feeds.
- **Inheritance:** `Ownable` restricts sensitive functions to the contract owner; `ReentrancyGuard` prevents reentrancy attacks.

---

### 2. Data Structures
```solidity
struct Token {
    AggregatorV3Interface tokenpricefeed;
    address tokenAddress; // Address of the token (0x0 for ETH)
    uint256 decimal;      // Number of decimals (18 for ETH, USDT, DAI, RVL)
    string name;          // Token name (e.g., "USDT")
}

struct LiquidityPool {
    uint256 token1Id;      // First token ID
    uint256 token2Id;      // Second token ID
    uint256 token1Balance; // Balance of token1
    uint256 token2Balance; // Balance of token2
}
```
- **Token:** Stores token details, including its Chainlink price feed and ERC20 address (0x0 for ETH).
- **LiquidityPool:** Tracks token pair balances for swaps, identified by a bytes32 pair ID.

---

### 3. Constructor and Token Initialization
```solidity
constructor() Ownable(msg.sender) {
    tokens[0] = Token({
        tokenpricefeed: AggregatorV3Interface(0x91f3Ff344623aDC499eC6A34fC6311e8Abbf7880),
        tokenAddress: address(0),
        decimal: 18,
        name: "ETH"
    });
    tokenPrice[0] = ETH_PRICE_USD;
    // Similar initialization for USDT, DAI, RVL
    tokenCount = 4;
}
```
- Initializes four tokens (ETH, USDT, DAI, RVL) with their Chainlink price feeds and token prices.
- Sets `tokenCount` to track the number of supported tokens.

---

### 4. Swap Calculation Logic
```solidity
function _calculateSwapAmount(
    uint256 _fromTokenId,
    uint256 _toTokenId,
    uint256 _amountToSwap,
    uint256 _fromDecimal,
    uint256 _toDecimal
) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 fromPrice = tokenPrice[_fromTokenId];
    uint256 toPrice = tokenPrice[_toTokenId];
    require(fromPrice > 0 && toPrice > 0, "Invalid price data");

    uint256 amountToReceive;
    if (_fromTokenId == 3) { // RVL as fromToken
        if (_toTokenId == 0) { // RVL to ETH
            amountToReceive = (_amountToSwap * fromPrice) / 10**18;
        } else { // RVL to USDT/DAI
            uint256 ethValue = (_amountToSwap * fromPrice) / 10**18; // RVL in ETH
            amountToReceive = (ethValue * ETH_PRICE_USD) / toPrice; // ETH to USD
        }
    } else if (_toTokenId == 3) { // USDT/DAI/ETH to RVL
        // Similar logic for ETH to RVL and USD to RVL
    } else { // ETH/USDT/DAI to ETH/USDT/DAI
        amountToReceive = (_amountToSwap * fromPrice) / toPrice;
    }
    return (amountToReceive * 10**_toDecimal) / 10**_fromDecimal;
}
```
- Calculates the output amount for a swap based on token prices.
- Handles special cases for RVL (priced in ETH) versus other tokens (priced in USD).
- Adjusts for token decimals to ensure accurate amounts.

### 5. Token-to-Token Swap
```solidity
function swapTokensForTokens(
    uint256 _fromTokenId,
    uint256 _toTokenId,
    uint256 _amountToSwap
) external nonReentrant returns (bool) {
    require(_fromTokenId < tokenCount && _toTokenId < tokenCount, "Invalid token ID");
    require(_fromTokenId != 0 && _toTokenId != 0, "Use ETH swap functions for ETH");
    require(_amountToSwap > 0, "Invalid amount");

    uint256 amountToReceive = _calculateSwapAmount(...);
    uint256 minAmountOut = (amountToReceive * SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE) / 100;
    require(amountToReceive >= minAmountOut, "Slippage too high");

    require(IERC20(fromToken.tokenAddress).transferFrom(...));
    require(IERC20(toToken.tokenAddress).transfer(...));

    emit SwapExecuted(...);
    return true;
}
```
- Validates token IDs, amounts, and liquidity.
- Applies slippage tolerance (98% of expected output).
- Transfers tokens using `transferFrom` and updates liquidity pool balances.
- Emits a `SwapExecuted` event.

---

### 6. ETH Swaps
```solidity
function swapEthForTokens(uint256 _tokenId) external payable nonReentrant returns (bool) {
    require(_tokenId < tokenCount && _tokenId != 0, "Invalid token ID");
    require(msg.value > 0, "Invalid ETH amount");

    uint256 amountToReceive = _calculateSwapAmount(...);
    require(IERC20(token.tokenAddress).transfer(...));

    emit SwapExecuted(...);
    return true;
}
```
- Handles ETH-to-token swaps by accepting `msg.value` and transferring tokens.
- Similar logic applies to `swapTokensForEth`.

---

### 7. Liquidity Management
```solidity
function addLiquidity(
    uint256 _token1Id,
    uint256 _token2Id,
    uint256 _token1Amount,
    uint256 _token2Amount
) external payable {
    if (_token1Id != 0) {
        require(IERC20(tokens[_token1Id].tokenAddress).transferFrom(...));
    } else {
        require(msg.value == _token1Amount, "Incorrect ETH amount");
    }
    emit LiquidityAdded(...);
}
```
- Allows users to add liquidity by transferring tokens or ETH.
- Initializes new pools or updates existing ones.
- Similar logic for `removeLiquidity`.

---

### 8. Admin Functions
```solidity
function addToken(
    address _tokenAddress,
    uint256 _decimal,
    string memory _name,
    AggregatorV3Interface _priceFeed
) external onlyOwner {
    tokens[tokenCount] = Token({...});
    tokenPrice[tokenCount] = gettokenPrice(_priceFeed);
    tokenCount++;
}
```
- Allows the owner to add new tokens with custom price feeds.
- Updates `tokenPrice` for the new token.

---

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Wallet:** A Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) with ETH and supported tokens.
- **Network:** Deployed on an Ethereum-compatible network (e.g., Sepolia testnet).
- **Approvals:** Approve the Swapper contract to spend ERC20 tokens.

### Steps to Swap Tokens
1. **Connect Wallet:** Connect your wallet to the Revolend platform.
2. **Select Tokens:** Choose the `fromToken` and `toToken` (e.g., ETH to USDT).
3. **Enter Amount:** Specify the amount to swap.
4. **Approve Tokens:** For token-to-token swaps, approve the contract to spend your tokens.
5. **Execute Swap:**
   - For ETH-to-token: Call `swapEthForTokens` with ETH.
   - For token-to-token: Call `swapTokensForTokens`.
   - For token-to-ETH: Call `swapTokensForEth`.
6. **Confirm Transaction:** Sign the transaction in your wallet.

### Adding Liquidity
- Select a token pair (e.g., ETH/USDT).
- Specify amounts for both tokens.
- Approve tokens (if not ETH).
- Call `addLiquidity` with the appropriate amounts.

### Removing Liquidity
- Select the token pair.
- Call `removeLiquidity` to withdraw all liquidity.

## Security Considerations
- **Reentrancy Protection:** `nonReentrant` modifier prevents reentrancy attacks.
- **Slippage Tolerance:** Ensures users receive at least 98% of the expected amount.
- **Chainlink Oracles:** Provides reliable price feeds (though token prices are used in this version).
- **Ownable:** Restricts token addition to the contract owner.
- **Liquidity Checks:** Prevents swaps with insufficient liquidity.
